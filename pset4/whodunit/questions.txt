1.  What’s stdint.h?

    Stdint.h is a header file that allows users to generate typedef structures.
    These can be given fixed-width integer types together with their defined minimum and maximum values.

2.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
    
    Using a clear, well-defined type allows the code to be safer easier and more effective to port as you are to a large
    extent making the code infallible. There is no ambiguity as to how many bits a uint8_t can hold, for example.
    
3.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?

    A BYTE can hold up to 1 byte.
    A DWORD can hold up to 4 bytes.
    A LONG can hold up to 4 bytes.
    A WORD can hold up to 2 bytes.
    
4.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be?
    Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."

    The first two bytes of any BMP files must contain the ASCII values of B and M.
    
5.  What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?

    biSize is the number of bytes needed by the struct  struct BITMAPINFOHEADER.
    bfSize is the number of bytes needed by the BMP file.
    
6.  What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
    
    If biHeight is negative, the image is top-down with the origin specified at the upper left corner.
    
7.  What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?

    biBitCount is used to specify the BMP's colour depth.
    
8.  Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?

    fopen could return NULL if the files it is trying to read or write to simply don't exist.
    
9.  Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?

    fread will always be one in the case are it is iterating over every pixel.
    
10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?

    3.
    
11. What does fseek do?

    The fseek function changes the file pointer to a new location. 
    
12. What is SEEK_CUR?

    SEEK_CUR is the current position of the file pointer.
